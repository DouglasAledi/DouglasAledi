# 👋 Hi, I'm Douglas Aledi

I am a Software Engineering student with a technical degree in Electronics from ETEC São Paulo (Centro Paula Souza). I have a strong foundation in hardware, electronic systems, and IoT projects, which gave me an integrated perspective between the physical world and software systems.

## 🛠 Professional Experience

I worked at Verisure performing technical maintenance on security equipment, handling an average of **700 repairs per month**, involving physical and electrical diagnostics, functional validation, and quality assurance. During this period, I focused on process organization, metrics tracking, and continuous improvement to enhance operational efficiency.

Currently, I work as a **Level 3 IT Support Technician**, providing technical support in critical environments for institutions such as Receita Federal, TCU, and TRT. My role involves solving complex technical issues, standardizing procedures, documenting processes, and improving service workflows, always focusing on stability, security, and performance.

I developed a **technical internal manual**, centralizing official documentation, system links, and detailed step-by-step procedures. This initiative reduced rework, accelerated service delivery, and improved process clarity for different user profiles — from contractors to analysts, auditors, and executives — ensuring high-quality and consistent support.

## 💻 Software Development

I am continuously deepening my knowledge in backend development, focusing on building well-structured APIs and scalable systems. I aim to apply organized, efficient, and real-world solutions, combining clean architecture, clarity, and performance.
